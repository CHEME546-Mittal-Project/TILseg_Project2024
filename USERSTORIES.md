*Immediate Future User*: Tool Developer: Bob <br> 
Bob is a graduate student whose research focuses on creating translational cancer diagnostic tools. Bob wants to adapt this software such that the input is a multiplexed immunofluorescent image instead of an H&E-stained images. Bob will work directly with the python scripts from this project. Bobe is technically advanced, but inexperienced with image processing. For this reason, he needs a software package that it thorough in external documentation and internal comments.

*Immediate Future User*: Package User: Maria <br>
Maria has image files who wants to use the software package to segment her H&E-stained images. She wants to be able to identify and enumerate immune cells in her samples but does not have much programming background. She wants to use this data as part of a workflow to evaluate novel treatment efficacies and make predictions based on disease subtype.

*Distance Future User*: Biotechnology Software Developer: Alice <br>
Alice works at an imaging machine manufacturer as a software developer. She is looking to create similar software that works directly with a new machine developed by her employer. To this end, the imaging machine would automate image segmentation of H&E stained images. Alice will work directly with the python scripts from this project. Alice is techincally advanced, and specialzies in image processing. However, she has no experience with H&E stained images. She hopes that this software will inform her of the unique challenges associated with H&E stained images. Like Bob, Alice needs well documented software to help inform her design.

*Final User*: Clinician: Robert <br>
Robert is a clinical pathologist. He would like to use this software to reduce variance in diagnosis between him and his colleagues. However, Robert would not work directly with the script and intead requires a user interface. Robert is an expert in H&E stained image analysis, but is not techonoligcally savvy. Robert will need an easy to use interface with a clear output.
