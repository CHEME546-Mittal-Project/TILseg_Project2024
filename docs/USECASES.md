## Use Cases
1. User wants to visualize immune cell clusters from H&E stained images
    - User Input: H&E stained image(s)
    - User Output: Image with overlay that indifies cluster location and size
<br/>

2. User wants to quantify immune cell clusters using H&E stained images
    - User Input: H&E stained image(s)
    - User Output: Statistical summary of immune cells clusters (including counts, sizes, circularity etc.)
<br/>

3. User wants to segment images into various tissue types
    - User Input: H&E stained image(s)
    - User Output: Image with overlay that identifies epthilium, stroma, and glass tissue types
<br/>

4. User wants to implement a clustering model for different types of images
    - User Input: N/A 
    - User Output: Pipeline for clustering on whole slide image 
<br/>

5. User wants guidance on H&E stained image analysis for diagnosis  
    - User Input: H&E stained image(s)
    - User Receives: Locations of high immune cell density for further analysis
